# Project

This is my attempt at calculating the brightness as observed from Earth of all stars in the observable universe. I used the inverse-square law for my brightness equation, and used the luminosity of the sun as my average luminosity of stars. The first half of the notebook is an attempt to calculate the brightness using the integrate function in sympy. The second half uses the odeint function in scipy.
